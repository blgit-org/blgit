blgit uses the following file structure:
```

template
â”œâ”€ html.j2
â”œâ”€ index.j2
â””â”€ post.j2

index.md

post
â””â”€ my_first_post.md

docs
â”œâ”€ index.html
â”œâ”€ index.css
â””â”€ my_first_post.html
```

The `.j2` files in the `template` folder control the appearance of your homepage and each post.

In the `post` folder, you write all your content in `.md` files. blgit is flexible with file structure, allowing you to use either a flat or hierarchical organization.

The `index.md` file serves two purposes: primarily, it contains the content of your homepage; additionally, it configures certain aspects of the blog generation process.

The `docs` folder is where the generated blog is saved.

Feel free to customize the `.j2` files to suit your needs. You can also add images and other files to the `docs` folder, as well as edit the `index.css` fileâ€”blgit will not overwrite or delete your files.

The `docs` folder should be uploaded to your static hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages).

To create this directory structure and generate your blog, simply run:

```bash
blgit build
```

**Tip:** If you don't want to run `blgit` after every change, you can use your favorite file-watching tool like this:
```
ls **.css **.j2 **.md | entr -c blgit build     
```
