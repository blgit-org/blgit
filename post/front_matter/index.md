Your `index_md` file should have a front matter section like so:

```
---
lang: en
url: https://blgit.org
date_format: '%d/%m/%Y'

title: blgit.org
description: Some description
image: /img/image.jpg
favicon: ðŸ”¨
---
```

Which will be passed to the template engine as key-val attributes.

Each of your post `.md` files should have a front matter section like this:

```

```

These are mandatory for the proper generation of the blog.
