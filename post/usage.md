blgit uses the following file structure:
```
index.md

post
â””â”€ my_first_post.md

html
â”œâ”€ menu.html
â””â”€ comments.html

docs
â”œâ”€ index.html
â”œâ”€ index.css
â””â”€ my_first_post.html
```

Where `index.md` is the home page of your blog and the `post` folder is used to host your posts. 
The `html` folder is where blgit is looking for html partials such as the top menu and the commenting service you chose to use in your blog.
Finally, the `docs` folder is where the generated blog is saved to. 
You can safely add images to this folder and edit the `index.css` file under this folder as blgit will not override or delete your files. The `docs` folder should be uploaded to your static hosting service (e.g. GitHub pages) 

To create this directory structure and generate your blog simply run this:
```
blgit
```
