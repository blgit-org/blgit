blgit uses the following file structure:
```

template
â”œâ”€ html.j2
â”œâ”€ index.j2
â””â”€ post.j2

index.md

post
â””â”€ my_first_post.md

docs
â”œâ”€ index.html
â”œâ”€ index.css
â””â”€ my_first_post.html
```

The `.j2` files under the `template` folder controls how your home page and each post will look like.

`index.md` is where you write the content of the home page and the `post` folder is where you write the content of your posts. 

The `docs` folder is where the generated blog is saved to. 

You can safely edit the `.j2` files to fit your needs. 
You can also add images and other files to the `docs` folder and also edit the `index.css` file as blgit will not override or delete your files. 

The `docs` folder should be uploaded to your static hosting service (e.g. GitHub pages) 

To create this directory structure and generate your blog simply run this:
```
blgit build
```

**Tip:** If you don't want to run `blgit` after every change, you can use your favorite file-watching tool like this:
```
ls **.css **.j2 **.md | entr -c blgit build     
```
